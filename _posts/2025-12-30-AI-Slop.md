# Ai is the worst thing yet according to Will Smith and I don't blame him

I was recently exposed to this concept called tranhumanism and the main issue that i find in ai and all the individual was is there attempt to make them human like or do human things.

it reminded me of the Quote from Will smith that says that goes somthing along the lines of 'can a robot write a symphany or paint a materpeace' and i agree with this alot.
